# BarTender-Barcode-Generator
The program is able to create an Excel database that can be imported in BarTender to generate a large amount of barcodes in a matter of seconds

<h2>Background</h2>

BarTender allows us to import a database (e.g. a Notepad or an Excel file), and thus generate a massive amount of Barcodes according to the fields encountered in the database. In this case, the program is adapted so that the user must only input a packaging date and a reference number (coming from a sales order), and the amount of products (boxes) sold for each variety of plants:

A database in an Excel file (.xlsx) is generated and on BarTender the database can be simply loaded and imported, generating the barcode labels:
